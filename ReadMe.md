Author : Ayush Paigude

Dataset : The dataset consists of 6 columns : Date, Stock_, Stock_2 etc. The size of the dataset is 366 x 5.

Desciption : This project leverages historical stock data from five companies to train a machine learning model that forecasts daily closing prices. Implemented in Python using pandas for data handling and scikit‑learn’s Linear Regression for predictions. Visualization of actual vs. predicted values provides clear insight into model performance. The Jupyter notebook guides you through data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation steps. Extendable to more advanced algorithms or additional stocks for deeper market analysis.
